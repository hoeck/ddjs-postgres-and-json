Notes: 3 things we might want to do with our JSON data

why JSON ? beacuse json is everywhere and useful

tired of mapping json to objects or the database tables

javascript/typescript makes working with json easy

from pretty old stuff - to contemporary stuff - to new awsome shitt

# Storing JSON

* every database can do this for ages
* JSON maps to text (except for JSONB)
* Postgres zips automatically üòé
* even MySQL has `COMPRESS` and `UNCOMPRESS`

Notes: IVI curve sims - 50GB of sim frame data zipped down to 5Gb

JSON vs JSONB

JSONB is a binary format for efficient querying - slower to store than JSON but faster to access properties

---

# Storing JSON - example

Postgres has a `JSON` type

<CodePane language="sql">
CREATE TABLE table_with_json (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  data JSON NOT NULL
)
</CodePane>

*EZ*

<CodePane language="javascript">
  {"import 'node-postgres'\n\n" +
  "const data = {foo: 'bar'} \n\n" +
  "await client.query('INSERT INTO table_with_json (data) VALUES (1)', [data])"}
</CodePane>

-> üëä simple-runtypes for type-safety of the json üëä

Notes: node-postgres does the mapping already

no type safety inside json but -> runtypes -> reason why I am okay storing json in databases

same for select - you just get a json back, node-postgres does that transparently

---

# Working with JSON in SQL

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-json.html

weird overall syntax and SQL type system

<span style={{color: 'red'}}>this is wrong:</span>
<CodePane language="sql">
SELECT id FROM table WHERE data->'foo' = 'bar'
</CodePane>

<span style={{color: 'green'}}>this compiles:</span>
<CodePane language="sql">
SELECT id FROM table WHERE data->>'foo' = 'bar'
</CodePane>

Notes: in Postgres, JSON and all other types (text, int) are not compatible and must be casted manually

many JSON functions are overloaded on input types

and for each JSON / TEXT return type there are typically two separate functions with similar name like -> and ->>

---

Useful for migrations:

<CodePane language="sql">
{"update assemblies\n" +
 "set body = jsonb_set(\n" +
 "             jsonb_set_lax(\n" +
 "               body::jsonb,\n" +
 "               '{telescoping, innerTubeCenter}',\n" +
 "               null,\n" +
 "               true,\n" +
 "               'delete_key'\n" +
 "             ),\n" +
 "             '{telescoping, innerTubeTop}',\n" +
 "             '200'::jsonb\n" +
 "           )\n" +
 "where body #> '{telescoping, innerTubeCenter}' is not null;\n"}
</CodePane>

Functions I have used so far:

* `jsonb_pretty` - pretty print json
* `jsonb_path_query` - get object at path
* `jsonb_path_exists` - test for presence of path
* `jsonb_set_lax` - create a new, modified json object
* `#>` - path accessor function

Notes: own weird path query language

json can be made into jsonb easily

now the good shit: json_agg

-> ran out of time üòê and this was supposed to be a lightning talk anyway
